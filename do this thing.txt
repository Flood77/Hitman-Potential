Chooses
destroy competition (kill jessie)
destroy overlord
destroy own company (kill blake)


majority hinting at endings + clues on overload
towards the end youll make your choice w/ jessie
either kill her then, go kill blake, or go get blake to take down overlord

kill jessie, destoyr her company, become best company
kill blake, recruited by overlord, and your company falls apart
talk w blake, the three of you kill overlord, ... you make your own company
